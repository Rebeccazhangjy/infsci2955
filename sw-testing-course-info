This course provides students with a broad understanding of modern
software testing and quality assurance. Although it will cover testing
theory, the emphasis is on providing practical skills in software
testing currently used in industry. To that end, it will cover: manual
and automated tests, test-driven and behavior-driven development,
performance testing, and understanding and developing a testing
process.

Grading:
         Mid-term Exam............ 15%
         Final Exam:.............  15%

         Group Project:
           -> Deliverable 1....... 15%
           -> Deliverable 2....... 15%
           -> Deliverable 3....... 15%
           -> Final Deliverable... 25%

Total: 100%.  The standard University of Pittsburgh grading scale will
be used.  Class participation may be used to decide grades on the
borderline.
100-94 A (A+ for extraordinary work)
93-91	 A-
90-88	 B+
87-84	 B

All groups are expected to do their own work on the group project, but
are more than welcome to collaborate and ask questions with other
groups, the Internet, or other colleagues.

However, any student caught collaborating or cheating on an exam will
automatically receive a 0 (zero) for that exam, and may be penalized
more harshly based on University of Pittsburgh academic policy.

The final exam will be cumulative.

It is recommended you keep all of your graded assignments until final
grades are posted and accepted, in order to resolve any discrepancies
in grading.

****

Lecture attendance is not required, but is STRONGLY recommended.
The instructor will try to ensure that all information on the exams
will be available via slides, but simply reading them may be
insufficient to understand the concepts thoroughly.

Presence for the mid-term and final exam are REQUIRED.  They will be
individually re-scheduled only in the event of an emergency.  If you
are facing an emergency, please contact the instructor IMMEDIATELY (if
it is safe to do so, of course).  Failure to show up for an exam
without clearing it first with the instructor will result in a 0
(zero) for that exam.

Group Project details -

Students will work in groups of two (which will change for the first
three deliverables).  These groups will perform the role of QA team on a
project which can be selected either by themselves, or assigned by the
instructor.  The final deliverable can be with groups of students'
own choosing.

It is highly recommended that these projects should be in Ruby or Java;
other languages will not be able to be supported by the instructor.

The group should check with the instructor as to the feasibility of
the particular project they are working on.  The instructor reserves
the right to allocate a project to the group, but will work with the
group to come up with a project which will be of interest to them.

Deliverable 1 - A list of high-level functional and non-functional
requirements for the software project and a test plan with
traceability matrix.

Deliverable 2 - Sufficient unit tests for a subset of the
project's functionality (requirements to be discussed in more detail
in class).

Deliverable 3 - Sufficient automated acceptance tests for a
subset of the project's functionality.  (requirements to be discussed
in more detail in class).

Final Deliverable -
  -> Two kinds of specialized testing - combinatorial, performance,
     etc., as will be discussed in class  This will depend on the project.
  -> A report on the quality of the project and areas which were or were
     not tested
  -> Final sign-off - does the QA team recommend releasing this product?
     Why or why not?

Deliverables must be handed in by close of class on the day that it is
due.  Late deliverables will be accepted up to two days late with a -30%
penalty.

****

Programming Language Selection

The instructor is open to groups using any programming language or
testing framework.  However, it is recommended that it be done in
Java or Ruby.  If your group decides to use another language, the
instructor may not be able to help with problems specific to that
language.
